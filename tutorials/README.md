# Notebook tutorials

Here are some tutorials of using the packages, including 

    1. Do perspective transform on a tilted solar module (This is merged with module classification)
    2. Crop out single solar cells from the solar module
    3. Classify the solar modules based on the number of defective cells
    4. IoU test of semantic segmentation
    5. Extract the features of the cracks from the solar cells

:warning: The pv-vision package is not published yet, so the `import` function may not work well in the notebook. You may need to import the package on your own. This will be fixed after the package is published.
